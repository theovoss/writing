# Should you listen to me?
probably not.

I'm just a mediocre software developer. I've only been doing this since 2012, and I've only worked at 3 jobs on around 6-7 different teams. That's not a lot of experience, though I have learned a bit. I'm writing this to clarify my thinking. I hope at some point it gets to the point where I can polish up my thoughts so it's useful for people. For now it's just a jumble of my own thoughts. proceed at your own risk.

# What do I do day-to-day
- take a task, break it down into a sequence of things that need to happen. do those things.
- thinking about the overal system and try to understand where my breakdown of things to do is broken/missing steps/which steps are wrong, then correcting them to finish the task I was doing incorrectly.
- play ping pong
- practice martial arts

# Why I'm writing this
I'm writing/organizing my thoughts in this programming overview due to several reasons.
1. I've always been curious about how to teach programming and I'm hoping this drives me to clarify my thoughts/wordage around concepts.
2. Several friends are mildly interested in understanding what working in software means/what I do for a living and I don't have great answers for that since it varies quite a bit from day to day.
3. Several friends are mildly interested in learning how to code a bit. I'm hoping parts of this would be helpful for that side of things.
4. Programming (actually writing the code) is actually the easiest part of my job, so I thought some discussion/thinking about what I'm actually being paid to do would be useful to me.
5. I just realized there should be a section on figuring out requirements/what you code you should actually be writing....
6. I recently was managing an intern at work and wrote up a single page paper outline that this is based off of. other than some naming changes, the initial outline.md is basically the same as what I wrote up for Lukas during one of our 1-on-1's.
7. I guess another section might be around understanding complex systems and using that knowledge to make minimal changes to fix complex bugs, propose new features, or communicate the potential of a system to management. Part of this section would come from my time at Modustri and how that system was designed, times it broke, and where it could have gone if it wasn't sold off.

# Is programming hard?
Actually writing code that does something isn't hard.

Writing code that you can easily understand when you come back and look at it in a month to addanother feature and generally improve things is a bit harder.

Writing code that other developers can easily understand and add on to is a bit harder.

Configuring tools to take the code you wrote and update a live version that people use to get stuff done is fairly straightforward (straightforward != easy or quick)

Working on 2-6 different/somewhat similar software products over the course of a couple years with a rotating team that needs to be brought up to speed and where you lose some team knowledge everytime someone leaves can be easy or can be incredibly hard.
