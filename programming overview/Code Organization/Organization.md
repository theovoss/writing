# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

# Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)/Keep It Stupid Simple (KISS)
Not sure which it actually is. I prefer the second one as you are insisting the code should be even simpler than what you might consider simple. Keep the code so simple that anyone who reads it know exactly what it's doing and why. So simple there's no way anyone could mis-interpret/mis-read it.
