# Best practices??
Not sure what to call this:
- scripting
- engineering
hmmm. I see a difference between scripts (ie 1. meant to be built/run by the same person/shared for personal use vs 2. code designed, written, and tested to be maintained by multiple people, 3. code somewhere in-between)

see code more like scripting from people still learning/just starting out, people in school/academia, ml. I've always worked on teams that aim to build for the team to understand and unit/integration test everything. I've seen code that does the same job as the later (many people using, many people maintaining) that doesn't have much testing or best practices... not sure how to describe that well/a good way to differentiate the concepts. Maybe it's a continuum of no to a lot of best practices when coding...

# Where code is run
1. scripting: on a computer by the person using the code, personaly as-needed use/1-time use
2. embedded
3. web
    - api
    - website/webapp
4. desktop app
5. mobile
6. machine learning/AI
7. hacking/penetration testing/security
