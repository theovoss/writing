1. Adjacent Skills
    - this is things like using a terminal, what an IDE is/why it's useful, how to start your code locally, version control, and a brief overview of different types/kinds of programming.
2. Basic skills
    - some basics of computer programming so that people who are brand new to code or haven't seen it before have some understanding of what code looks like/how it works
3. Momorization/familiarity
    - this documents some common things you find either in a standard library, common libraries brought into projects, and just common things you should be able to find a pre-made solution for so you don't have to re-invent the wheel with what you learned in basic skills
4. Code Organization
    - this is different thoughts about how to organize code. things like DRY, KISS, folder structure, testing, api design, ect...
5. Working with a Team
    - this is common things to be aware of/ask the team about how they work when you are working with other people. Things like code reviews/pull requests, how to review code, structuring a commit, things to configure tools to do for you/your team
6. Operations
    - this is a section for how to maintain a live service. focussed primarily on web-dev, but maybe will have concerns for other types of software as well. How to monitor, document solutions, root cause issues, fix things so they won't go down again. I'll mention some things around my time at Modustri and Amazon. Won't really mention much from my time at DornerWorks.
